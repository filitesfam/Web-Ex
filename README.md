Today, there are numerous websites where you can find reviews of doctors from different
specialties that work in different healthcare sections. Online reviews are a concern for
healthcare because patients use online review sites to select doctors more frequently these
days and more and more of them trust these reviews. According to a latest study, 84% of patients use internet reviews to assess doctors.

Companies and web scrapers can collect information using a web scraping tool and store the information. Then the information obtained
can be used to enhance the companyâ€™s performance and can also be used for further analysis.

The project was based on CareDash website to scrap the review data of the doctors, CareDash is a website for doctor's ratings and reviews. Doctors are ranked with 1-5 points in total on CareDash. The review requires a title and an explanation of why the rating was given.
We chose this website because it has many reviewers and reviews. 

Finally, we have successfully completed our task by scraping the data set of the doctor's review, reviewers, name of doctors and their specialty from CareDash website, the total number of reviews that we scrapped was around 2378. The extracted data was saved in MySQL database and exported in CSV format for ease of use.
